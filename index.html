      <p> Hey, I'm Jon. I know quite a bit about a lot of things and this site is going to tell you about what I know and how I apply that knowledge. </p>
         
      <p> This webpage is meant to be both a personal repository of my skills and hobbies, and a way to show off my professional skills. Over time, this page will get upgraded from base HTML, to showing off what I want certain users to see. My goal is to get this page to a point where there is two separate versions. One for a casual viewer, the other for professionals and prosprective employers. </p>
